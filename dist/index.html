    <h1>Firebase Analytics Minimal Setup</h1>

    <p>To check if the client is sending events to the server:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open your browser's Developer Tools panel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Go to the Network tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refresh this page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Look for a network POST request (it will be delayed a few seconds after
        page load) to "https://www.google-analytics.com/g/collect?... (plus a
        lot of params)"
      </li>
    </ol>

    <hr />
    <p>
      If that network request is <strong>successful</strong> (200, 204),
      Firebase analytics is sending events. One of the params should be
      "en=page_view". This event is automatically sent on page view even if you
      did not explicitly log an event with Firebase Analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
      If that network request is <strong>not there</strong>, or was
      <strong>unsuccessful</strong>, please let us know as much detail as
      possible about the browser environment you checked this page from.
